# Linear Algebra in Rust

This is personal project developing a linear algebra library in Rust while taking a linear algebra course. The main goal is to apply and reinforce the concepts learned by implementing vector and matrix structures and operations.

The library is a work in progress, and features will be added and improved as I progress through the course.
